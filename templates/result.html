          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Consult a doctor</h3>
              <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
              <li>The most common specialists in the field of diabetes are endocrinologists.</li>
              <li>Endocrinologists specialize in hormonal issues and the glands that produce these hormones.</li>
              <li>People with type 1 diabetes usually remain under the care of an endocrinologist for most of their medical care. People with type 2 diabetes will also need to see an endocrinologist.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Take an A1C test</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The A1C test is a blood test that provides information about your average levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar, over the past 3 months. The A1C test can be used to diagnose type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. The A1C test is also the primary test used for diabetes management.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Lifestyle Changes</h3>
              <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li>Lifestyle changes can help prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease. Prevention is especially important if you're currently at an increased risk of type 2 diabetes because of excess weight or obesity, high cholesterol, or a family history of diabetes.</li>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <h5>Lose extra weight</h5>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li>Losing weight reduces the risk of diabetes. People in one large study reduced their risk of developing diabetes by almost 60% after losing approximately 7% of their body weight with changes in exercise and diet.</li>
                      <li>The American Diabetes Association recommends that people with prediabetes lose at least 7% to 10% of their body weight to prevent disease progression. More weight loss will translate into even greater benefits.</li>
                      <li>Set a weight-loss goal based on your current body weight. Talk to your doctor about reasonable short-term goals and expectations, such as a losing 1 to 2 pounds a week.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h5>Be more physically active</h5>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li>There are many benefits to regular physical activity. Exercise can help you:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Lose weight</li>
                      <li>Lower your blood sugar</li>
                      <li>Boost your sensitivity to insulin — which helps keep your blood sugar within a normal range</li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h5>Eat healthy plant foods</h5>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li>Plants provide vitamins, minerals and carbohydrates in your diet. Carbohydrates include sugars and starches — the energy sources for your body — and fiber. Dietary fiber, also known as roughage or bulk, is the part of plant foods your body can't digest or absorb.</li>
                      <li>Fiber-rich foods promote weight loss and lower the risk of diabetes. Eat a variety of healthy, fiber-rich foods, which include:</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Fruits, such as tomatoes, peppers and fruit from trees</li>
                        <li>Nonstarchy vegetables, such as leafy greens, broccoli and cauliflower</li>
                        <li>Legumes, such as beans, chickpeas and lentils</li>
                        <li>Whole grains, such as whole-wheat pasta and bread, whole-grain rice, whole oats, and quinoa</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>The benefits of fiber include:</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Slowing the absorption of sugars and lowering blood sugar levels</li>
                        <li>Interfering with the absorption of dietary fat and cholesterol</li>
                        <li>Managing other risk factors that affect heart health, such as blood pressure and inflammation</li>
                        <li>Helping you eat less because fiber-rich foods are more filling and energy rich</li>
                      </ul>
                    </ul>  
                  </li>
                  <li><h5>Eat healthy fats</h5></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li>Fatty foods are high in calories and should be eaten in moderation. To help lose and manage weight, your diet should include a variety of foods with unsaturated fats, sometimes called "good fats."</li>
                  <li>Unsaturated fats — both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats — promote healthy blood cholesterol levels and good heart and vascular health. </li>  
                  
                <li>Saturated fats, the "bad fats," are found in dairy products and meats. These should be a small part of your diet. You can limit saturated fats by eating low-fat dairy products and lean chicken and pork.

                    <h5>Skip fad diets and make healthier choices</h5>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li>Many fad diets — such as the glycemic index, paleo or keto diets — may help you lose weight. There is little research, however, about the long-term benefits of these diets or their benefit in preventing diabetes.</li>
                      <li>Your dietary goal should be to lose weight and then maintain a healthier weight moving forward. Healthy dietary decisions, therefore, need to include a strategy that you can maintain as a lifelong habit. Making healthy decisions that reflect some of your own preferences for food and traditions may be beneficial for you over time.</li>
                      <li>One simple strategy to help you make good food choices and eat appropriate portions sizes is to divide up your plate. </li>
                    </ul>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Fruits, such as tomatoes, peppers and fruit from trees</li>
                        <li>Nonstarchy vegetables, such as leafy greens, broccoli and cauliflower</li>
                        <li>Legumes, such as beans, chickpeas and lentils</li>
                        <li>Whole grains, such as whole-wheat pasta and bread, whole-grain rice, whole oats, and quinoa</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>The benefits of fiber include:</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Slowing the absorption of sugars and lowering blood sugar levels</li>
                        <li>Interfering with the absorption of dietary fat and cholesterol</li>
                        <li>Managing other risk factors that affect heart health, such as blood pressure and inflammation</li>
                        <li>Helping you eat less because fiber-rich foods are more filling and energy rich</li>
                      </ul>
                    </ul>  
                  </li>
                  <li><h5>Eat healthy fats</h5></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li>Fatty foods are high in calories and should be eaten in moderation. To help lose and manage weight, your diet should include a variety of foods with unsaturated fats, sometimes called "good fats."</li>
                  <li>Unsaturated fats — both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats — promote healthy blood cholesterol levels and good heart and vascular health. </li>  
                  
                <li>Saturated fats, the "bad fats," are found in dairy products and meats. These should be a small part of your diet. You can limit saturated fats by eating low-fat dairy products and lean chicken and pork.
                </li>
              </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h5>Skip fad diets and make healthier choices</h5>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li>Many fat diets — such as the glycemic index, paleo or keto diets — may help you lose weight. There is little research, however, about the long-term benefits of these diets or their benefit in preventing diabetes.</li>
                      <li>Your dietary goal should be to lose weight and then maintain a healthier weight moving forward. Healthy dietary decisions, therefore, need to include a strategy that you can maintain as a lifelong habit. Making healthy decisions that reflect some of your own preferences for food and traditions may be beneficial for you over time.</li>
                      <li>One simple strategy to help you make good food choices and eat appropriate portions sizes is to divide up your plate. </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </ul>
